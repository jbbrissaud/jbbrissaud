- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jbbrissaud
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in scala3, zio2, and the development of fast, easy to maintain, web applications.
- ðŸŒ± My choice of 'framework' is totally opinionated: 
    Scala3, for the server AND the client. A cool, strongly typed, very regular language, using indentation.
    zio-http for the server, zio + laminar for the client. For me the best combination, by far.
